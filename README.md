# Sales-Dashboard-Project
This project involves building a Sales Dashboard for a Supermarket Shop to analyze key business metrics like total sales, total profit, sales trends, product performance, and category distribution. The dashboard was developed using Excel with data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques.
 Dataset Cleaning & Preprocessing

## ðŸ›  Steps Taken:

 - Loaded the dataset into Excel and examined the structure (rows, columns, missing values, duplicates).

- Removed duplicates using:

- Data -> Remove Duplicates

- Handled missing values by:

- Replacing empty values in numeric columns with 0 or interpolating where necessary.

- Standardized data formats:

- Dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD

- Currency values properly formatted.

- Created new calculated columns, such as:

- Profit: = Sales - Cost

- Profit %: = (Profit / Sales) * 100

### ðŸ“Š Data Analysis (Formulas & Calculations)

- Several formulas and pivot tables were used:

- Total Sales Calculation: =SUM(Sales)

- Total Profit Calculation: =SUM(Profit)

- Profit Percentage: = (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100

- Monthly Sales Trend: Using a Pivot Table with SUM(Sales) grouped by Month

- Product Performance Ranking: =RANK(E2, E:E, 0) to rank products by sales
